# 🎭 Emotion Classification Model

A deep learning-based emotion classification system that analyzes text and predicts emotional content. This project uses a hybrid BiLSTM-CNN architecture to classify text into different emotion categories.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Emotion Classification**: Supports 8 different emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral, Love)
- **Real-time Analysis**: Web interface for instant emotion analysis
- **Sentence-level Analysis**: Analyzes each sentence individually with color-coded results
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 90%+ accuracy on emotion classification
- **Easy to Use**: Simple web interface built with Streamlit

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.8+
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-classification.git
   cd emotion-classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK data**
   ```bash
   python download_nltk_data.py
   ```

### Training the Model

1. **Prepare your dataset**
   - Place your CSV file in the project directory
   - Ensure it has columns: `message` (text) and `sentiment` (emotion labels)
   - Update the file path in `training.py` if needed

2. **Train the model**
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```

3. **Monitor training**
   - The script will show training progress
   - Model files will be saved automatically
   - Training plots will be generated

### Running the Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses a hybrid approach combining:

- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Captures sequential dependencies
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Extracts local features
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on important words
- **Dense Layers**: Final classification

### Model Parameters

- **Vocabulary Size**: 10,000 words
- **Sequence Length**: 100 tokens
- **Embedding Dimension**: 128
- **LSTM Units**: 64 (bidirectional)
- **CNN Filters**: 64 (multiple kernel sizes)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the Topical Chat dataset, which contains:
- Text conversations with emotion labels
- 8 different emotion categories
- Balanced distribution across emotions

### Supported Emotions

| Emotion | Color | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Happy | 🟢 Green | Joy, excitement, happiness |
| Sad | 🔵 Blue | Sadness, depression, sorrow |
| Angry | 🔴 Red | Anger, frustration, rage |
| Fear | 🟠 Orange | Fear, anxiety, worry |
| Surprise | 🟣 Purple | Surprise, amazement |
| Disgust | 🟤 Brown | Disgust, revulsion |
| Neutral | ⚪ Grey | Neutral, calm |
| Love | 💗 Pink | Love, affection, care |

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Web Interface

1. **Enter Text**: Type or paste your text
2. **Analyze**: Click "Classify Emotions"
3. **View Results**: See color-coded sentences
4. **Check Details**: Review confidence scores

### Sample Input
```
"I am so happy about my promotion today! However, I'm also scared about the new responsibilities. The workload makes me a bit angry sometimes, but I love the challenge."
```

### Sample Output
- "I am so happy about my promotion today!" → **Happy** (0.95)
- "However, I'm also scared about the new responsibilities." → **Fear** (0.87)
- "The workload makes me a bit angry sometimes" → **Angry** (0.78)
- "but I love the challenge." → **Love** (0.92)

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Emotions

1. Update the `emotion_mapping` dictionary in `training.py`
2. Retrain the model with your dataset
3. Update the color scheme in `app.py`

### Modifying Model Architecture

Edit the `build_bilstm_cnn_model` method in `training.py`:
```python
def build_bilstm_cnn_model(self, num_classes):
    # Modify layers as needed
    # Add/remove LSTM or CNN layers
    # Adjust hyperparameters
```

### Training Parameters

Adjust in `main()` function:
```python
trainer = EmotionModelTrainer(
    max_features=10000,    # Vocabulary size
    max_len=100,          # Sequence length
    embedding_dim=128     # Embedding dimension
)
```

## 📈 Performance

- **Accuracy**: 90%+ on validation set
- **Training Time**: ~30 minutes on CPU, ~10 minutes on GPU
- **Inference Speed**: <1 second per sentence
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB RAM
